Sentiment analysis is a process that uses natural language processing (NLP) and other techniques to determine the emotional tone of a text: 
What it does
Sentiment analysis analyzes text to identify if the tone is positive, negative, or neutral. It can also be used to quantify and study subjective information. 
How it works
Sentiment analysis uses algorithms to process data, which can be rule-based, automatic, or a hybrid of the two. Rule-based approaches use manually crafted rules, while automatic approaches use machine learning. 
What it's used for
Companies use sentiment analysis to understand their brand, products, and services, and to improve customer experience: 
Social media monitoring: Companies can use sentiment analysis to understand what people are saying about their brand online, and how their brand perception evolves over time. 
Customer support: Sentiment analysis can help customer support teams process requests more efficiently. 
Market research: Sentiment analysis can help companies identify trends and new opportunities for growth.
